# CP1404 Practicals

## About the Repository

This repository contains practical work completed for the subject **CP1404 - Programming II** at James Cook University.  
The practicals are structured by week (e.g. `prac_01`, `prac_02`, etc.) and demonstrate progressive learning of Python programming concepts.

My name is Harshini Raghuram, and Iâ€™m currently studying Bachelor in Cybersecurity. These practicals have helped me strengthen my understanding of writing efficient, readable, and maintainable Python code.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- Meaningful variable and function names improve code readability and reduce confusion.
- Using functions to separate concerns makes the code easier to test, debug, and reuse.
- Consistently applying formatting (PEP 8) and commenting enhances both human readability and collaboration.
